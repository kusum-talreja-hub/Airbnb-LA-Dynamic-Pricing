# Airbnb-LA-dynamic-pricing
Dynamic pricing involves many steps, like historical data and regression models. These models understand how different factors, like location and reviews, affect the price. The objective of this project is to use Airbnb historical data and to determine the pricing predictors for the listings. This information will be further used to predict optimal prices for the properties by creating a linear regression model.
